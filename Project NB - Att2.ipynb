It features randomised dungeons every time, though you can unlock a feature to lock the previous anscestors castle if you so choose so you can play through it again for anything you may have missed or failed the first time through at the cost of earning only 60% gold on the playthrough.Classes are all unique in their own ways with their own pros and cons (I personally preferred the Ninja/Hokage) and traits can provide some useful and not so useful mechanics to help or hinder you. Its a long grindfest at first since you are pretty weak at the start, but as you level up and upgrade your stats and equipment it does get somewhat easier though it still provides a challenge regardless.The story is kind of there but not all that interesting though there is a interesting plot twist at the very end, though story can be found as well through diary entries you will discover through your numerous playthroughs. It can be a long grind to the top but I find its worth it in the end.\n",

      "This is a very unique FPS game with 9 classes with their own perks and roles, ranging from the genius Engineer to the mysterious Pyro, and special events such as Halloween with limited cosmetics. There are millions of possiblities with this game (Thanks to the many unique hats and weapons) and there is a constant stream of free updates and patches. TF2 (Team Fortress 2) rarely has hackers (If any) on servers due to a very reliable and effective anti-cheat system (VAC). TF2 also has a kind and welcoming community so, new players can get familiar with the game with ease. TF2 is also very balanced  so you don't have to spend a fortune on the game just to get the hang of it. As I mentioned before, there is a diverse range of well-made cosmetics and weapons to personalise your characters just the way you want them to be. There is also a constant stream of weapons/weapon reskins and cosmetics that are made by the glorious steam community with their amazing item-making skills. Oh, did I forget to mention that there are many taunts to annoy the hell out of your enemies? So what are you waiting for? Try this game out NOW!\n",

I've hoped for a new Dungeon Keeper for years so when I saw the kickstarter for WFTO I jumped straight onboard. I didn't play it while it was in beta, I wasn't interested in guiding the game through its development, I just wanted it made, I didn't play it when it first went Gold, I heard it was buggy, and read the message from Subterranean Games, so I waited a bit longer, until today...This has been sooo worth the wait, I'm only a few levels in but absolutely loving it, it looks fantastic and plays brilliantly and hearing Richard Riding's voice brings me straight back, thank you Subterranean Games for bringing this classic gameplay back to life with such love, I can finally throw away my DK 2 install disk!\n",

      "This is a quick intro for those who want to get into the franchise but actually haven't played a souls game. I know I needed this when I started.The good:-You can build a character around a variety of archetypes, want to be a reaper complete with scythe and dark magic? What about a shield and spear hoplite? Maybe you feel like beating people to death with an anvil-on-a-stick while wearing stone armour. You can. -Fighting isn't just swapping out weapons with different numbers, you get invested in your gear. You've chosen to be a reaper? Well you'd better learn how to reap with that build. No matter your setup you will learn to use it and you will have to behave differently for each. -When you're on fire it feels like being Neo dodging bullets without the slow mo. It could all come crashing down in an instant but for a while you're untouchable.The bad:-Not holding your hand is a selling point but when you don't have a clue about certain game mechanics you're pretty much boned unless you find a guide. Read up on effigies, game progress routes and the Emerald Herald.-\"It's a game that too often sacrifices fun, replaces it with tedium, and tries to defend that choice by calling it a challenge\" I'm not proud of quoting gamespot but this was always stuck in my mind. As newcomer, aggroing one enemy at a time, cheeseballing, and even waiting for hp to regen before moving on (I know, I know, but gotta hoard effigies) seemed to be the only way to play. All to avoid having to repeat a section, lose my souls and lose precious max hp.The ugly:-Tongue but holeSumming up, you will have to be persistant. If you can accept that it might take a few dozen deaths to clear an area and let your rage go then it's a rewarding game.\n",

      "Decided to write this one a quick review because at the time of writing it's on sale. I bought this game a few months back when it was $20 and it was worth it. It's a fairly challenging coop shooter with Zombies and it's a lot of fun. Plus it's 3 games in one, so for $8.99 it's a steal. This game features the stories from NZA 1 and 2 with updated textures, an exclusive third story continuing on from the other two that you can only buy in this collection, and a decent survival mode which is also exclusive to the trillogy. All are available in 4 player coop.It has a fairly healthy online community, but it's certainly best with friends, which is why I don't have much time on it. That said, it has a certain dark humour to its story which makes it both endearing, but also a bit terrifying at times. If you're a fan of Call of Duty Zombies, particularly World at War, you'll probably love this. I have a fairly mid range PC (AMD FX-6300, R9 270x) and I run this at 80 fps 1080p on high with supersampling off and it runs beautifully. The graphics are pretty decent too.If using an Xbox controller is your thing, the controller support is fantastic. Simply turn it on at any point and it'll work just fine. I use a 360 controller, but the game most certainly supports an Xbone controller too (it's image is used in the controls section of the options).Basically, buy it now while it's on sale because it's great. If you happen to read this after a sale, it is still worth getting it over the other two if you want both.\n",

      "ok so when you purchase this game the first thing you have to do is go to the nvidia website and download the legacy driver otherwise this game wil come up with a stupid agia physics missing error and WILL NOT LAUNCH and it will drive you mental.I started the game and had a sound hardware error which was stupid. no sound but to be honest the game mechanics allow you to easily play without sound. graphics completely maxed out still seem outdated for a 2009 release. however I have to say that graphics don't make or break a good game. frontlines offers a multiple path choice play style which I am rather a fan of in an fps. its great to be able to choose how you want to get to a target. i thought the health system could do with some improvement. I semed to get hit a hell of a lot yet didnt seem to lose much in the way of health, and I found the constant birage of new spawning enemies somewhat unrealistic. however if you like a tactical run and gun style gameplay with constant enemy attacks to overcome then this is a good game choice.I thought the size of this game was a little on the high end. (above 10gb) but I gues for the age of it and the probable unnecessary programming for the time I cant complain to much. I just wish it had been a bit longer play time for the size.overall, now that I have the sound issue fixed, I found this to be an enjoyable title. Hovever for the age and play, I found the original farcry to be a much better more well thought out game, except for the 2 stupidly annoying boss battles. my oppinion if you want this game get it and you shouldnt regret it, but get the original farcry aswell and note the difference for yourself.\n",

Between the story, the beautiful graphics, music score, and the insanely enthralling card game mini-game, Final Fantasy VIII does the series proud. This is the RPG that proves if you got a great story and solid characters it can still be a damn good game despite some glaring flaws. This is the best and most memorable game i have ever played, and everybody who loves RPG games will without doubt love this game. First laid eyes on this game on my 11th birthday, my dad got me a ps1 and this game. Grew up playing it. This was the game that would spark my love of gaming and the rpg genre. You probably think that you can't trust my review since I'll be blinded by nostalgia but I played this game again recently and loved it. Played, loved and obssessed on it as a child. Played, loved and obssessed on it as a manchild.It has a good mix of humor and seriousness, the combat system works well.

THe pure comical action with the witty and slandish british comedy that riddles the game is fantastic, and the FPS mechanics are just perfect (although there are a few glitches in the system when changing weapons and such, but this is mainly due to the inferiority of the engine not that actual game, and they are quite bearable)The Visuals are decent, not fantasitic or amazing, but they will satisfy you, for the game itself makes up for that. \n",

I tried to be witty there.Now, I'm not one to do really large reviews, but I can tell you this: Buy this game.A ton of people will go on and on about how it sucks, how it's stupid, but it's a really fun RPG game for those that are into the genre. And a lot of people have gone on to say that it's just a time waster, but no, it's more than that. Like an RPG game, it'll take you into the story the best it can. It's up to you, if you let it do it's job or not.And as such, this took me to believe that not many people gave it that starting chance. The chance to change their lives forever.Now, you might be thinking I'm biased, and yeah, I am. I never got the chance to grow up with great games that were released on older gen consoles. Like the NES, the SNES, and even the Sega Mega Drive. I got to miss the truly astonishing ups and lows of gaming history. All because I'm a kid. So, when a game like this comes along, a game that does so well at giving the player a feel of the old world, I take it like it's a van full of candy.But, TL;DR: Buy this game if you're into the genre, you won't regret it.\n",

Since then there has been no regret to buying this product, the graphics have greatly improved, the gameplay is tighter and faster paced and the humour is nearly original Portal level in my opinion with lots of clever quips and references that you have to really see and search for.There is one thing however that must be though of when purchasing this, make sure you have a friend to play it with because as with any game that requires a bit of grinding a friend goes a long way to seperating boredom from adventures into hilarity.A geniunely good game if you do not mind the occasional What the Heck!!!! moments from enemies.\n",

      "A pointless DayZ mod story:I played this game endlessly for over a year, playing vanilla DayZ mod from mid-late 2013 to early 2014 when I moved to DayZ Epoch. On the quiet Epoch server, the next few months were a blast as I became a loyal member and moderator of the Redline Gamers community until it died down over late 2014.After all this I can tell you my time playing DayZ has been the most entertaining, often exhilarating, sometimes calming and unforgettable experiences I've had ever.There is nothing more stressing than going to loot a military base  in fear of a far ghillied sniper. Nothing more angering than your pilotting friend crashing your precious helicopter into a mountain because he was \"looking at the map\". Nothing more enjoyable than the memes, jokes, good times and friends I've made being part of a community here.Ive talked to many different people, made friends and heard stories. Witnessed many acts of great kindness and many acts of pure evil. And witnessed some of the most unreal situations and events that only this game, in all it's realism and conplexity, could create.Whether you are genuinely trying to survive in the attempted realism of DayZ mod or gearing up a base with your friends to murder every other player in DayZ Epoch, this game is the right stuff. Two years on I still remember some of the things that happened in this game and people I've met.

Many people buy this game believing that it will be the same or similar to the 4X style of games (Explore, Expand, Exploit, and Exterminate) and ending up not liking this game. If you believe this, I would not recommend this title due to you. Otherwise I would recommend Europa Universalis to you.\n",

      "Killing floor is a wave based zombie shooter with 8 different types of zombies/mutants and a player limit of 6 or so (many more on modded servers though). Game play is basic you pick a perk (Demolitions (grenade launchers and my fav), Support (shotgun and welder), Sharpshooter (pistols and rifles), Berserker (Melee weapons), Pyro (flame based weapons), Medic (Obvious), Commando (Assault rifles). You can purchase weapons of any class at the end of a wave at a trader which is open for a variable amount of time based on settings. In addition to your weapons every class has a medic gun and a welder (both work only at melee range) but their effectiveness is based on your perk. You can weld certain doors and gates closed letting you hold off the horde that little while longer. Guns sound awesome, a decent variety for each class. You are limited by a weight limit for how many weapons you can carry though (not by slots). The base game has quite a few maps including a couple of objective maps as well as a few sandbox settings and difficulty levels. The base game is quite fun for the first few weeks but starts to get samey/grindy which is why i HIGHLY recommend to play on a modded server. There is also a lot of things on the workshop page (especially modded maps) which i also recommend checking out too. The workshop is why i kept playing from 30 hours onward. The game also has holiday orientated events (Halloween redneck zombies, evil Santa)Graphics are okay (game is a couple of years old) and it is very gory with no geo block :D. Which is why the demo class is so fun XD. Sounds are pretty good, guns feel nice (especially the 9mm). Maps vary from open, outdoors, corridors, small e.c.t so there is a lot of variety there. That about sums up KF, its simple but fun. I would recommend it (especially on sale), it also is still receiving updates. (Don't think i forgot anything).\n",

      "If you didn't already notice, this game's concept is loosely based off of the Maximum Overdrive movie in the 80's. Except in this game, you get to play as the machines taking over the world. The gameplay is fun, and very satisfying. The visuals are nice. They are somewhat akin to that of Katamari Damacy. As of right now, there are only 3 modes, all of which have different goals (Did not get to play the Sandbox Mode when I tried the game, but it's basically like the other modes, just with no goal). In arcade mode, you try to destroy as much as possible, to score as high as possible within 3 minutes. In Gman elimination mode, you must destroy a certain number of MIB (Men In Black) before the time runs out. Overall, the game was fun, and should get better with more refining whilst in early access. The only gripe I have with the game, is that the controls feel a little strange, mainly when operating the camera when you aren't in a vehicle, and are searching for one to control on the map. Overall though, i would recommend this game :)If you're interested, i made a video on the game, which i've put below.\n",

And grappling hook. That thing can do anything.\n",

      "Let's start off with something, this game is amazing.When you first start off in the game your going to be put in a Battlefeild/Counter strike enviroment, choosing between two teams (Insurgency or Security), you will be faced with a detailed loadout selection and class selection. Each class on each team has access to different guns, attachments etc. And you have a set amount of equipment tokens/points to spend on your loadout. You also have a weight meter which can determine whether your loadout will make you run fast or slow, and how fast your stamina will run out.Now lets get into the combat:The combat is fast paced at times and slow paced at others, you will constantly find yourself having to visually inspect whether you have killed a person and wondering \"should i check or should i run past and hope the enemy is dead\". From the last sentence you probably can tell the game is going to be realistic. It is. If you move up on your own your playing a wild card, instead you might want to call out a couple of your teammates to help you complete/capture an objective (Yes, there are a lot of different gamemodes to choose from, most of which include control areas). There is virtually no HUD (Heads Up Display), the only things that do show up on the hud is how many magazines you have, and info about the objective(s). The gunplay is realistic, recoil is a thing and attachments can supress that recoil but also you can by swithing modes on your gun or burst firing. 1-2 bullets from most guns can take down an enemy.Lets talk graphics:The graphics in the game are not spectactular, but still enough to immerse you in the gameplay, though the design and textures on the weapons look great. You can't really expect a game run and made on the source engine  and is only slightly modified is going to get you amazing Battlefield graphics.Overall Gameplay:The gameplay is realistic, tense and rewarding if you play the game right, what a mordern military shooter should be, it offers great and realistic gunplay, a variety of gamemodes and maps. Insurgency will keep you coming back to play some more (also teamwork is a thing in this game).\n",

It gets a little bit boring at times but it was probably just me being impatient. I'm gonna get my friends to check out this game because every time I play it makes me fell so happy it's crazy. It would make me the happiest person ever if you made  a sequel where you go back to live with them after either breaking up with the one you chose or continuing the story with the relationship still going. Either way I would love to see some sort of follow up. You have my full support the whole way.

At first you laugh at people spending money on this game, next minute you're drawing blood from a stone, and bam, all your cash is gone. That is the only catch. Lightwallet/10 would pay again.

      "I have played so many Free to Play games, but so far this is the only example of how good a F2P game could be.  Replayability :- 7/10  Constant updates :- 10/10  Events every month :- 10/10  Dev's interaction with players :- 9/10  Real F2P aspect :- 9/10  Inevntory management :- 3/10  At the start of the game you are given all heroes to play for free until they reach level 10, level 60 is max for unlocked heroes. Once you are done deciding which hero you want you can unlock 1 hero for free to lvl it to 60 (I suggest taking Deadpool 1st, since he has no energy cost and is fun to play).   Everytime you play the game, the game will drop Eternity Splinters for you to pick up, don't ignore them. You can use those Eternity Splinters to buy more heroes from the 'Eternity Splinter\" vendor. You don't need to spend real/steam money for playing the game. The only thing you can might need to spend money is the costumes, but random costumes can be crafted too when you do Prestige. Prestige is releveling a hero from 0 to 60 once again, everytime you prestige you get a original costume of a hero, you can use 3 of the original costumes to craft 1 random costume.  There is atleast 1 event going on every month which will keep you hooked up to the game. The devs make sure the events are glitch-free.  The only thing I don't like about this game is that the default inventory is too short, and the Eternity Splinter price of STASH is also too high (600 Splinters) which takes long time to aquire compared to Random hero unlock box (175 Splinters).  Overall rating for the game :- 8/10\n",

Great story quite similar to Last Of Us in a few ways.The complaints about the level of influence your decisions have in the story are made by people expecting too much. This isn't developed by some AAA studio with a megabudget, the narrative follows the same pattern as the Mass Effect series, you end up in the same place with a slight variation in who you are, who is around you and what happen outside of the core story.The 400 Days DLC is quite a good filler between seasons 1 & 2.\n",

      "A nice little RTS that is essentially a stand alone expansion  to 8 Bit Armies. With a total of 4 factions to chose from now (assuming you also have 8 Bit Armies) the 8-bit experience is definately much deeper  than before with larger selections of units and strategies. Military vs Fantasy is also pretty cool. I do believe however, the game is a little unbalanced (eg mass air ), but that is to be expected as the game has just come out. There are also a few typos here and there (eg the tech trees). It would also be pretty cool if we could still have the 8-Bit Armies music in the game when the original factions are selected. If 8-Bit Armies' support was anything to go by, I'm sure Petroglyph will give 8-Bit Hordes the same treatment with constant tweaks and updates.Definately reccomended for fans of RTS or anyone who is looking for a more laid back experience.\n",

Mission settings such as \"onsluaght mode\" makes things interesting in the sense that you can have it off and run through the missions as intended and take your time, or turn it on to penalize slow movement due to massive hoardes that... well swarm... you every minute whether you move or not.

Anyways, it was a beautiful game with fast and stylish combat as well as vivid characters and decent humour. I suggest you give it a try until the end. The main problems for me when playing is that, the game is quite slow and tedious. At the beginning, of course this shows the most but as you progress through, entering each area and doing each quest was indeed slow. It was worthwhile though because you were awarded with rewards. I still recommend this game for all ages. I have friends playing this game from as young as 10 to 30 xD. 8.5/10 Great combat and story.\n",

      "This would have to be one of the best Early Access titles that I purchased. Being a big fan of the original installment, when I heard about the second installment, I was excited. Did this game manage to live up to the excitement? Yes, Definitely! The only \"flaw\" currently that I have found is the lack of content, BUT! This game is in Early Access and more content will obviously be added. From the (as of 24/04/2015) 4 hours that I spent playing this game, both solo and with friends, I feel like this game has incredible promise.The good:*Visuals - This game's visuals are stunning. The graphics have received a very nice upgrade from this game's predecessor, without taking away from the style that the first game portrayed.*Performance - This game has very good optimization. I was able to run the game on medium to high on my low end PC and still manage a stable 60fps, with only a few ocassional drops.*Gore - The gore system got a massive overhaul, which just makes it so much more satisfying to blow the heads off of Zeds and watch it literally explode, spraying everything in blood. Each Zed has a huge amount of points of dismemberment, so you can quite literally tear them limb for limb.*UI - The user interface got some heavy tweaking compared to the first game, making everything more sleek and easy to access. The Vendor Pod has a very nice interface as well, with everything laid out infront of you without having to scroll down or across.*Classes - Although only 4 of the classes are available at this point in time, the skills/class perks feel rewarding for the effort you put in. *SDK - The game has been noted to have the SDK and community creations implemented later on in development, which is great, as I found the community creations one of the best parts of the first game.*Humour - That's right, the wonderful British banter from the first game makes a comeback, better than ever. I mean who doesn't love British people insulting zombies. :P*Dosh - Aww yis, the dosh now has physics! You can literally make piles of money. When encountered with large crowds, it can be quite annoying being spun around every couple of seconds having to bash a zed away, only to be grappled by another one and spun around. I personally preferred the grappling from the first game, where they just slow down your movement, until you can't move.*Servers - I'm giving the game credit with this one, but I'm just going to list it here for the time being, since I consider it a negative part. (At this point in time). Currently the servers that are available are almost all full, with only a few with much higher latency being available. All of the ones with great ping and empty are privated however. This wouldn't be too much of a problem, but as of this point in time, the method for creating a dedicated server for the game is quite tedious. >Also, I'm not sure if this is a glitch, but 90% of the time, when a game is finished I am often sent back to the main menu screen, even on my friend's game<All in all, if you're a fan of the original installment, I'd highly recommend picking this up. If you're a bit sceptical about purchasing games that are in Early Access, I'd probably suggest giving this one a miss until the price drops for a sale, as there currently isn't too much content. If you've never played the first game in the franchise, but you're interested in Zombie Survival games, such as Left 4 Dead, I recommend giving this game a try. I can definitely see myself sinking more hours into this game as it develops.\n",

Being able to actively switch between the four different suit mods alows you to instantly adapt to changing situations, add on the instant weapon customisation  and you get one of the most dynamic shooters out there. Still remember one  of my favorite moments in gaming is when i punched a truck into a Korean soldier nocking him flat on the ground only for his buddy to accidentaly shoot the gas tank and blow him up.All in all a great sandbox to endlessly fight an intelligent and tough enemy.*NOTE*(this game dosn't run on some versions of windows.

I can say the same for the Far Cry series too.  I suppose I could add Just Cause to the list it beats but I have only played 3 hours of JC2 after getting a little tired of it, the same can't be said for SR3 though, it made me want to come back for more and more!Saints Row 2 was indeed a poor port in the fact that driving was fairly hard as the game played at an increased speed.

Yes it has FPS lag on a few maps like Defender or Instict but only for a minute or two,after that the game is fine. -This game is heeps of fun with some friends in a private,online match,or just on your own playing online!-Storyline is AMAZING!-Bunch of new gamemodes like Uplink,Momentum Etc.-I Really recommend this game! \n",

      "At first I found this game a bit challenging, but after a bit of getting used to I have found it easier and is one of my favourite games of all time, recently I have been playing heaps and the community is a lot friendlier behind this game aswell, example at the end of a CS:GO game 'gg' at the end of a CoD game 'You fkn suck go to hell'. The game is well made and the continuous content updates are great, a good thing that separates Golbal Offensive from Source is the new guns and the weapon skins for each gun giving you the ability to have cooler looking guns, and more importantly StatTrak which gives players who can afford it the ability to count their kills. The micro-transactions in this game are not forced onto you but it is a good way to gamble, like if you spend $20 on an unboxing and get a $120 knife from it you made profit, or you lose money (that is why it's gambling), and the operations which give you earlier access to community made maps and keep a personal record of your competitive scores. This game is one of the best First Person Shooters out there and I'd give it a 9/10. The EMS competitions give players the chance to try get their name out there in the CS:GO community and also win big cash, and for those who are not a good enough player who can't assemble a team it is great fun to wath.\n",

      "The Bootleg rifle: Massive magazine, medium rate of fire , medium damage, low acurracy, medium stability, low concealment, medium threat.                   This is basically a smaller lmg, which is great because you get to use iron sights and don't have to worry about movement speed as much, while still having the room clearing potential, the accuary is rather low to begin with but can be easily modded to increase to a reasonable amount.                              The Anarchist perk.                 Replace some of your health with armour, regain armor from killing enimies. This perk deck is great because it can essentially let you become a\"mini tank\", being able to have heaps of armor but still being really mobile.                The Wing Butterfly knife.        Pretty average melee, same stats as most other knives but has a awsome charge animation.                Sydney. I love this character, i know people might find her high pitched voice annoying, but i like it. Maybe it's because i'm australian but i don't mind the accent.

      "Early Access Review The road so far...Ark Survival Evolved has its flaws currently as all day one games in EA, but it has a lot of potential, It has a deep levelling and crafting system, requiring time and effort in gathering and crafting, It's combat is kind of clunky but once you unlock that slingshot you'll never go back to just bashing a dinosaur , while I haven’t manage to tame a dinosaur yet ( started to tame a carno that had attacked my house, but when I went to kill a couple of the massive turtle dinosaur's they wrecked my house and the passed out carno :C )  I think it’s an amazing and fun, engaging mechanics making you care for that one pet you will value over the rest. So far only the graphics to play this are letting it down in my opinion (my specs below.)  I hope with more optimization and when DX12 comes out soon it will get a lot better. To list this out.Pro’sDeep rewarding crafting System.levelling system.Massive open world full of horrors and thing's that want you for food.Fun tribe system with friends.Solo offline mode allowing you to learn and get the hang of the game before online.Dev's actually seem to care and have updated the game and fixed bugs all thoughtout day one.Con'sRequires graphics tweaking even for higher cards.Some small physics bugs e.g. body's flying and being tossed away abit.Mostly the biggest con for people is it requires a beast of a machine and even then you need to tweak the graphics.But after all that I’ll keep playing it, because I so far find this the most enjoyable Survival game out.Computer Spec'sProcessor.Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790 CPU @ 3.60GHz Graphics Card.NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 Ram. Kingston HyperX Beast 16.0 GB OS.Microsoft Windows 8.1, 64-bit Upgrading my GTX760 soon to a new GTX970 (about 2ish weeks away)Will update my review when It's installed & I've played it.I wish there was more than Yes/No for review Early Access games, but so far if you can tweak the graphics right I recommend this over other early access survival games.Thanks for reading.Deatheffekt.Update #1 Patch 171.511 Hours mostly all in game I doubt even an hour is in the menu/server list, and I honestly say if you can get this running get it, I've loved every second of it.The updates since day one have been great, the game runs way better for me atleast and looks amazing, the hard work the dev's are doing will pay off, and I honestly see this being finished one day if they keep doing this.\n",

I can honestly say that SALT has really done an incredible job the Dev's I take my hat off to.What I cannot believe is that I was just in time to see some real development in the game, as I began playing SALT just before this update was released, so I was able to see the ship models and textures before. after the update I was blown away by its detail upgrade. Highly recommend SALT and can only assume the best of its potential.I would say 10/10 but as I am only 2 hours in, I will have to give 8/10 until my excitement and enthusiasm dies down.

      "What are these people talking about, I don't understand!There is not ONE massive problem I found in No Man's Sky and I had no lag spikes AT ALL in my whole entire playthrough.These people who whine about the game being laggy and all must have Windows 3.1 with a graphics card of a calculator and RAM of a potato! Jokes aside they are most likely blind and are way below the system specs to play this fantastic masterpiece of a game.And so what if Sean Murray lied? Subnautica has higher ratings and that's not even as big as No Man's Sky. And Subnautica has almost the same graphics as NMS so what's your problem?! Sure, multiplayer may or may not be implented because of ONE INCIDENT. But even if Sean Murray lied about that just accept the way NMS is! Not as many Subnautica features were lied about but even if they were, what difference would it make? The same's with NMS. Subnautica doesn't have Multiplayer, and so what? NMS doesn't either! Review No Man's Sky is actually a very fun game to play. Watching it is boring as hell, though. I immediately got hooked into the game as soon as I started playing. Unfortunately this game isn't for everyone. There's little variety in the genre and it really sticks to one thing; Exploration. If you can't stand exploring planets on foot and seeing different terrains, this game isn't for you.Also you can't build in No Man's Sky, just pointing that out.Now here's the good bit. On every planet you go to, all the animals' voices are different, they look different, EVERYTHING. IS. DIFFERENT. No joke, even the plants! On every planet! Imagine that, a game with everything completely unique to the last planet you visited. Nifty eh?Now no game is perfect and the same's with this game. Obviously this is indie so I won't be too harsh. Pros • Endless, unique gameplay.• Two different endings: Galactic Core and Atlas Path.• Every single creature is never the same from the last ones you saw on a different planet.• Ship varieties. (I often wait around at space stations waiting for an epic looking one)• Awesome soundtrack that plays throughout your gameplay.• 3 different races you can trade with, all with unique voices.• Massive exploration on either barren, rocky planets to lush planets filled with trees and life. Cons • Eventually gets a tiny bit repetitive.• To save, you must find a shelter. You can't just save anywhere.• Hard to find a good ship with lots of slots• Hard to get better Hyperdrives to travel to better systems (from worst to best, Yellow, Red, Green,      Blue)• Slow start. (except for people who preordered the game, you are fine.)Overall I think the game is great, and if you like exploring planets then the game is for you. Buy it while you can\n",

I've found it to be stable and smooth on a wide range of computers, from low-powered laptops to high-end rigs, so it's also a good game for travelling with.The biggest challenge in the game is the city building rather than the combat, it's more a city simulator than a wargame (again, like Caesar or Pharaoh). \n",

Other than that I enjoy customizing the cars for the coasters or the colors of the paths or que lines. I enjoy the fact that the peeps have a mind of their own. Some dont like to ride certain rides, some only like roller coasters.The Coaster Builder. - Took me alot of time to get used to, forgetting to use shift to make it rise, or tilt. I enjoy the fact that some coasters can spin, reminded me of *Thrillville off the rails*.I enjoy the fact that the mascots seem to make everyone happy. I also enjoy that there are SO MANY differnt food buildings, theres like 4 different buildings just for tacos and salads!!!One thing that I really really enjoy is that I can ramp the paths, like, I made a little river, so I boosted the path up to go over the river, and I put a wooden rollercoaster track under and over it, so My peeps can enjoy a good coaster on the entrance of the park. The performance isnt 10/10, nor is the FPS, but it is playable....Im surprised my FPS lasted pretty good with the ammount of items and peeps in the park, there were around 1,800 peeps in the park and over hundreds of differnt pieces. 6 Roller coasters spread out all over. 60+ food buildings, 8 mechanic buildings with 10 mechanics for each building. 5 entertainer buildings, once again 10 entertainers for each building. 9 Janitor buildings, 10 janitors for each building. atleast 80 plants and trees, a lake, and over 10 thrill / family / and Junior rides.....

All this game really boils down to is a point-and-click adventure game with some short combat sequences, from a side-scrolling perspective. The atmosphere is well-made, but I feel a majority of the puzzles are a bit too open-ended (for one, you have to jump underneath a ten-foot-wide elevator where the only control panel for it is on the elevator itself).Again, it's not worth it in its current state.

      "The game is remniscent of the Dungeon Keeper series and provides a slightly nostalgic feel. The graphical style and detailed overworld are quirky and creative but are ultimately overshadowed by the slow placed and repeitive gameplay. A major downfall is in its lack of flexible micromanagment and preset room layots. Players are also prevenetd from changing preset room layouts at the start of each new map which limits creativity and needlesy increases difficult as the treasure hold is always placed close to the entrance (where enemeies enter to plunder your dungeons treasure). Imire does provided a wide range of unique creatures and a interesting team combo feature, rewarding creative team combinations. The storyline also contains interesting aspects. Overall the agme is satisfactory if you want a casual play but is no Dungeon Keeper 3.\n",

It's nothing more than an outsourced poorly realized package. Design choices in terms of the lighting were completely thrown out as just one example, another is just how incredibly buggy it is.The lighting that I refer to was a \"gold\" tint of perhaps Jensen's augmentations in first person and even indicative perhaps of a \"new renaissance\" thematically. This was in promotional footage, cases etc. There are other visual differences but this is the biggest. They completely ignored the original teams aesthetics and choices.\n",

      "Poor oversight by Magic 2015 developers in the game.Positives include a catchy theme song, ability to construct a deck to however you like, storyline is not a bad inclusion, opening more boosters to provide anticipation and excitement.Sadly however the negatives definately out weigh the positives.You are restricted in deck building to a limited selection of cards after you have completed the campaign unless you which ti invest in \"boosters\" to increase your card pool. Matching up against others who have superior cards or/even duplicates or sets of 4 card(s) whom have purchased additional boosters, not only makes deck building difficult, ineffective but also increases the likelihood that you will be demorilised over and over again in matches against other opponents in 1 v 1 or free for all matching.I generally enjoy purchasing this product for the puzzle games, Last turn puzzles a few years ago were amazing and difficult/challanging. 2014 however showcases some very sub par puzzles games and this year, well, there are none.I played one game of free for all on 4 v 4 and I felt so far away from the game table I requested my flatmate to provide me a magnifine glass. myself and another player also realised 4 turns in that we had already lost when one of the players threw down some superior cards for which we had not even access to.This put me off continuing playing this game into the future as really there is no point unless I am wishing to invest into this.Suggestions would be to at least bring \"two headed giant\" match making back, a level par card selection by perhaps charging a set $15 fee from the start and not this \"micro transaction booster option\" which is poor oversight in my opinion and perhaps even a tournament mode where equal par magic the gatherers could paticipate tournaments of 10 players etc, round robin to then provide a level based system and a decent points rating for those wishing to climb to the top in rankings over time (by winning more tourney's etc)Rating, interface, music score, Story concept 6/10 (as what else can you do with a story really)gameplay campaign 5/10 (as well the AI seems to get the perfect run of cards sometimes :S)Deck building feature, 8/10 as this is very flexibleCard selection 2/10 (extremely limited unless additional investments made)gameplay vs human 3/10 (for the reason you will become frustate that you are unable to build a deck that is consistent without investment into more booster packs)Overall I would probably rate Magic 2015 4/10\n",

      "Hack, Slash, Loot, or \"HSL\", looks charming at first with it's retro-style pixel art... until you realize that the gameplay is even more primitive. It is not an understatement to say that everything in this game either comes down to little more than random chance and comparing numbers. Combat is completely limited to clicking on an enemy until they die. That's it. No special moves, no abilities, no changing gear, nothing. Sure, depending on your weapon you either use melee, ranged or magic attacks, but unless you're fighting near a weapon drop you can't change on the fly, plus your character will usually specialize in one type so there' very little reason to change unless you get VERY skewed consumable drops (more on that later). At best you can try to bottleneck enemies in doorways or tight coriidors to fight them one by one, or run away and hope you find something useful before you get surrounded, but that barely qualifies as \"strategy\". And even then, you still have to hope that RNGesus is smiling down upon you. The item system is almost as primitive. Most of the time, it feels less like you are trying to decide which weapon or piece of armor to equip, and more like you're just comparing numbers (although special damage types such as the stunning Lighting do make things a little more interesting) As for consumables, you never know if a potion or w/e will help and/or hinder you, meaning once again it's entirely up to luck rather than any sort of choice or strategy if it help you.Oh, and there's no save system. At all.All in all, this game had a lot of potential, but instead the gameplay is comparable to banging your head against a wall while comparing helmets and popping pills that \"might\" make it hurt less. What this game needed was something, ANYTHING that might have made the gameplay more complex than dice rolling: Abilities/items to use in a pinch, swapping around weapons, etc etc: anything that would make success less dependant on how lucky you are. If you're at all thinking of picking up this title anyway, I highly recommend buying another game called One-Way Heroics instead, which in a nutshell is practically like this game with the improvements I just suggested, and at only somewhat more than half the price.\n",

      "This game is ver well made, very pretty, and great in theory, but I found myself getting bored and frustrated with it quickly. The main purpose of this online game is to gather provisions, build a base, and defend said base against raids, or you can raid other bases. I have two major problems with it though. 1) the game's servers frequently reset, which can be every week, or more. This results in the base you spent so much time building, which may be days, to be erased. 2) as I mentioned, you can raid bases or be raided by other players. However, you are left vulnerable whilst you are offline. So people can raid your base while you're not there to defend it. This is really awful as it takes an incredibly long time to research and produce certain items.Some players may find this thrilling or challenging, but I find it frustrating and pushes me away from spending time in the game.

      "Excellent game made by skilled artists and 3D modellors. The team that manages the engine and physics are quite good, though not the best. Aircraft and vehicle modelleling is the greatest I've seen for a game with such a variety of vehicles. Gameplay is amazingly smooth and simple.I cannot recommend it due to many controversial decisions made by the developers. Ignoring the playerbase in terms of balancing the matchmaking. Gaijin have created a problem that only becomes worse. When there are many players playing a large range of vehicles, (generally) effective matchmaking would clump a few evenly matched vehicles together for an intense fight.However if a vehicle was introduced/\"balanced\" to be too effective/ineffective, naturally people would flock/avoid that vehicle. This creates increased queue times due to the inbalance of demand of vehicles. People complain and Gaijin allows a wider variety int he one game, this can (and did) lead to further imbalance. Thus, more people avoid it/leave. This makes the balancing act harder and both Gaijin and the playerbase stressed.Of course, this depends on your reason on playing War Thunder and the matchmaking may not be a concern, also Gaijin isn't doing too badly at the moment, it's just greatly inconsistent matchmaking leading to either utter defeat or victory simply due to vehicle selection and not player skill.Any aircraft could easily kill a much higher tiered aircraft if they're not using their speed advantage or experience. I have killed MiG-15's in an F6F Hellcat. However in ground forces, it is practically impossible to kill a much higher tiered tank due to their armor and firepower keeping you at a massive disadvantage.Game Modes:Arcade Battles:Best place to learn the ropes, manoeuvres target leading, positioning, awareness and map knowledge. Physics have been tweaked for faster gameplay and easier to handle aircraft. This mode is where I spent about half of my time on, learning how to fly different types of aircraft and their weapons. Ground forces arcade is very intense and can be very much run, gun, die repeat. Dodging cannons rounds and ramming enemies off cliffs.Realistic Battles:Common for more skilled players like myself. Vehicles perform closely to historical documents (which aren't the most accurate due to multiple sources). Requires extensive knowledge of own vehicle, enemies and map to effectively defeat the enemy. In this game mode, teamwork and communication is also introduced. (Yes, teamwork and communication is almost non-existent in arcade) NOTE: Although teamwork is indeed key, people are people and will sometimes be selfish or ignorant which can lead to many losses. You basically have to hope that your team isn't braindead to charge the enemy into a disadvantaged position.Simulator Battles:What is this? DEAD :(In aircraft used to force cockpit views and requires a joystick (although with practice you can go without). It tries to have the primary components of real combat without having to worry about issues real pilots have. Can be very intense however it has an extreme learning curve and almost certainly requires a wingman. Like RB, however these skills are truly put it to the test.The game indeed has its great moments, when the odds are stacked even greater against you than the developers intended and you still break through. However too often you'll just die hopeless, with the only way of avoiding it is to drag out the match.\n",

I don't understand how US, EU and Asia all have 4 - 5 servers each, but there are no Aussie servers.Which means lag, lag and more lag for us Kangaroos.So while in any other circumstance I would be most wholeheartedly recommending this game, the lack of Australian servers disallows me to see a reason to.I mean, seriously!

It may sound really boring, but the gameplay experience with friends is enough to satisfy your whole day.Why give this a NO for a reccomendation? It's because the game's dead. Very few updates, very few online players also since the head developer left and SEGA not really supporting this game to its full potential, the game became too repetitive with no new contents now and then.It's still shiny, it looks good but the game experience is all gone.

      "TL; DR version: for $9.99, this dlc is short and does not add any real content to the game that you can not go without.Now for the long version. I got this dlc as a part of my season pass, so I didn't pay the $9.99 price tag. But if you didn't buy a season pass and are considering buying this dlc separately, I recommend you do not.There are really only two new characters with a decent amount of interaction introduced in this dlc. One I felt was developed very well, and will keep as a companion for a while. The other, was very shallow. There was barely any character development to make me feel anything for them. They could have been a no name raider and plucked at the same heartstrings during the big choice of this dlc.The robot customisation added by this dlc is quite neat. All of it balances nicely with no obvious power play options. And it's fun to have your own custom companion. But this, ultimately, is no different to any other companion. Sure, I can give them sword arms, but I could just give another companion a sword for the same effect. The interface is also slightly confusing; it is difficult to follow what change in damage/resistance a mod will cause without doing the manual check yourself. I was beginning to trust those little +++.Coming into this dlc with a lv 50 character (playing on survival) I really only felt challenged on combat at one stage in this dlc. That's not isolated to this dlc though, I feel fallout 4 has difficulty issues regardless. But this dlc does nothing to rectify this.Oh and if you're not a junk hoarder then I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors amassing your new hoard if you want to build any decent robot mods.There are a few new weapons added in this dlc as well, with the majority being mele, then energy. These are not something a level 50+ is going to start using though. Even with full modification, they fail to pack any considerate punch.There are also some unique power armor mods added in this dlc, but they are non transferable and will only benefit energy weapons users.In the end this dlc adds some cool features to your settlement and a cool new companion, but other than that there is nothing really new that is worth the $9.99 pricetag if you're considering buying this dlc outright.\n",

      "The game started off as awesome. I can remember the times when you progress into new teirs and levels, unlocking different armours, weapons, and utilities. This was great fun up to this point - until alll of a sudden - the updates happened. The diversity of different tiers and levels, dissapeared - the uniqueness of designs, gone - The all-round game play, terrible.What made this game so bad in the end, was the fact that they decided to take all the hard work, grinding, and time off all the users, and just deleted it. Sent everyone back to an abysmal tech tree which made a level 100 and a level 1 the same sturdiness (armour wise). And the devs didnt even refund those who lost their hard earned robots.The development team needs to recognise that what they are/have done has turned a great oppurtunity into a train wreck. This CAN CLEARLY BE SEEN IN REVIEWS. Unless drastic restorations to the game are conducted. YOU WILL NOT ENJOY THIS GAME.\n",

First of all, let me start off by saying that Black Ops 3 is a Triple A title meaning that it has a huge corporate funding behind it. Obviously we'd think that the game would at least be half decent with such a large budget and skilled staff behind its creation. So in conclusion, this game is probably one of the worst Triple A title games you will ever purchase and whether the Triple A title is worth $15 or $100 (like this one) this game is definitely not worth it in anyway. The PC optimisation is absolutely terrible with a bombshell of issues from frame lag to being unable to play the game until you have at least spent a solid night or two getting destroyed by fellow players.\n",

      "Sad sad Ubisoft. Don't get me wrong, this is a beautiful, extensive, and immersive game. It is an above ground and underwater city builder with complex city management and trade.  HOWEVER, UPlay is a horrendous gaming network and a DRM of 3 installs is appalling (to say it kindly). When I discovered I could only install this on 3 machines I was quite disappointed. Ubisoft support also seems seriously lacking. My son recently made purchase of a hardcopy ubisoft title, registered it to his account but could not download it - was just stuck in a registration loop. He was outright ignored by Ubisoft/Uplay official support contact - even after posting for help on their Facebook page. Eventually he exchanged the game for something worth twice as much (and not needing Uplay). So he posted again to their facebook to let them know he didnt want their assistance anymore because they are useless and he had solved his problem. Within minutes they deleted his post from the page making us well aware that Uplay had seen his original help request but they had deliberately ignored it.I'd hate to see what will happen when I have to contact them for a new key for Anno when I next upgrade my machine. If the same DRM restrictions exist for the new Anno when it is released I simply wont be buying it ... ever. In fact my experience with the few Uplay games I do own has taught me to be extremely wary of investing in any Ubisoft games again.\n",

      "POSITIVESGreat Game! Really fun and there is a lot to do in the game that makes you want to continue to play. There are unlockables like Perks, Offerings, Clothes, Items, Addons etc. You can level up your characters as well as your rank for both Survivor and Killer.You can also play private matches with your friends and you won't lose anything if you do die as a survivor.The ranking system in my opinion is good enough for now; you collect these crystals (at least they look like crystals) called PIPS, according to the official Dead By Daylight Manual, and when you collect a certain amount in a row,  you get promoted. The lowest rank in the game is 20 and the highest rank is 1. To get from rank 20-19 you must collect 3 pips. From Rank 12 and onwards, you must collect 5 pips each rank down, meaning Rank 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 require 5 pips each before you get to Rank 1 for both Survivor and Killer.So the game seems cool, right? Well, most games aren't that perfect...TLDR: Great Game, Fun, Lost of Unlockables, makes you want to continue playing, Private Matches, Ranking System, Collect Pips to Rank Up, Rank 20 lowest rank, Rank 1 Highest Rank.NEGATIVESThe only way to rank up in the game is to play public matches, and this makes it difficult because people try and find their friends so they search and quit lobbies until they find them because you currently CANNOT invite your friends to public matches, only private matches, and some players just boost each other. For example one person plays as the killer, hosting the lobby and the other playing as a survivor, and they troll you. There are many disadvantages in the game too, such as:- The host of every game is the killer. This is bad because almost every killer in the game has a .... ISP.- Everybody is searching for their friends, and sometimes it can take a while to find a game. The longest it took me to once find a game was 1 hour for this reason...- You will lag in almost EVERY game.- You WILL rage.- You WILL die in stupid ways.- You WILL get stuck in objects.- There are HACKERS in this game too!Now it's time to elaborate on these points. The killer being the host of every game really annoys me, just because it gives them a huge advantage. Think of it like this; The host controls everything, and you and your friends are normal people doing normal stuff. But the host has .... internet, and because he controls everything, it affects you and your friends WAY more than it does for him. As a matter of fact, it doesn't affect him at all. LAG will ruin you, and make you rage. I've lost many games just because of lag. But how does the lag affect you in game? Well, when you attempt to vault over something, like a wall or object, and you're lagging, you are going to die, especially if the killer's chasing you, because what happens is that rather than vaulting, your character FREEZES. Lag also makes you teleport literally everywhere and will get you killed. This is why you will rage and die in the most stupidest ways.You will also get stuck in objects. One time I spawned into a game (The developers call these TRIALS) and I was repairing a generator. Then the killer was coming towards me and I was thinking, \"Oh no problem, I will just hide behind this tree.\" So I go behind 'This tree' and crouch and he walks past me. \"Yeh I'm all good.\" I think to myself. Then I go to walk away from the tree and then just like that, I was stuck. I literally couldn't move, and the murderer was coming back. He walked past me again and didn't see me. Although he didn't see me, I was still very angry, because I wasn't going to be able to survive unless I get him to kill me. So I just quit and also got demoted and lost my item. This is why the Killer has such a HUGE advantage in the game. This also isn't the only object I've gotten stuck into.I have recorded games I've played where my connection with the Killer was very bad, and I will perhaps upload them soon to my Steam profile/YouTube channel (Link on Profile!). So be sure to check those out if you would like to see more on what I'm talking about.Last but not least, hackers, yes, there are hackers already... And the game was only recently released, EVEN with an ANTI-CHEAT! This just really confuses me as to why their anti-cheat software hasn't even banned these players yet. I saw a player who had prestiged his Claudette Morel to level 1000, which at this stage, is an impossible stage to even be on. Most players, almost all, haven't even prestiged, including myself. TLDR: Game has more negatives than positives. ConclusionSo to conclude my review, this game needs more development. The game is great and fun, but when you take the negatives into account, Dead By Daylight isn't really the best game to buy at this time. I believe the developers didn't give enough time on their project and should have continued developing the game and released it at a later date. But the developers are still working on patches and have apparently said they wil be allowing people to invite their friends to public games instead of just private games. So to say they should be adding more patches as well. But in the meantime, I recommend you should save your money for the time being and wait till more patches come through.Thank you for reading my review!\n",

Toy Soldiers: War Chest is simple not worth the money that it asks for £11.99 (for the standard game) and £24.99 (for the hall of fame addition). Although it includes characters from different franchises you have to pay £3.99 for the privilage of owning that character - such as GI Joe and Cobra which is a real kick in the teeth! But the game forces you to do this as the basic armies are crap! The only playable basic army is the WW1 German Army, the rest are boring, stupid and a waste of time.

      "This game is OK but not worth the $1 to throw at it. Not know that this was an early access game I threw myself in to it hoping for a fresh game, one I haven't seen before. So I did what I usually do... Not look at anything on the game. Well now I wish I would and finding out that it was early access after I had played it makes it worse. I already have a dislike to early access as most games get forgotten and unfinished and I don't like the idea of paying for a game that hasn't even been finished and the devise thought they could get a couple of bucks out of it before they actually bother finish it. I know this isn't every early access game but a lot are like this. This game from the looks of it was either rushed, not cared about enough, or by inexperienced devise. Im sorry if it's the last option but you will need some helpful criticism. First of all I noticed the controls for the torch, these are horrible you can either not do anything and it will snap to the direction you are facing which leads to very disorientating gameplay ad there is no smooth animation for the snap lock and leaves the player felling more or less dizzy, or you can hold the left mouse button the whole time to control the torch which is annoying while trying to do platforming but is much easier then the snap control. This was very annoying through he whole game as you do have to use the torch as a weapon and making it a prime function without taking much care for smooth animation is not done well. While trying to find an option to maybe have it as a consonant on the mouse control I found myself exiting the level which made me instantly dislike this game. First of all there was no are you sure you want to exit the level, second no indication what so ever through the game did it say if you want to exit the level press ESC, this may not seem like that big of a deal and it wouldn't be in any other situation but in mine I was near the end of the level with all the collectibles and I had exited and was forced to play the level again but this time I ha dlost interest in collecting the letters. Another issue I have is that there are no options, none what so ever, except when you boot up the game it asks what graphics you would like windowed yes or no and resolution, for the very basic of settings these are there is no way to change them in game. One other thing that really bugged me about this game is the ... narrator, jeez can you come up with some different lines, every single level has the narrator saying the same thing over and over again, it's like a broken record, and I'm not kidding at the start of every level there is the same cut scene of the narrator saying some bull and during every level he says the same thing, and at the end of every level there is another cut scene. Not to be discouraging the narrator has a nice voice but maybe get him a few more then 3 things to say. Now one thing that really bugged me about the game play was that every time you die you go all the way top the start of the level usually this would be OK, it gives consequence to the players death but it is so easy to die in this game from the odd camera angle and the (let' face it) cliché platforming with no real unique aspect means you have to start the level again and when this happens you loose all of your collectibles. This is the most frustrating part because even though the platforming is hard simply because of other issue and not the way it is designed, a big portion of the game comes froms getting the collectibles and after dying a few time to some random issue I quickly lost interest in getting the collectibles which unlock additional levels, which I could not bring my self to even collect the letter to play because I found myself wanting to stop playing this game instantly. Another aspect of the game I didn't enjoy was the enemy if you can even call them that, there are two enemy's, white slug things that slowly move towards you and little white sperm things that move quickly towards you, for a game with the subtitle 'A game to fight inner demons' I did not find myself fighting any inner demons the most I got was having a good laugh at the ridiculous design of an 'inner demon' and the variation of these inner demons (the small sperm things) do not come in till the 4th level which is the second last level in the game. Which brings me to my next point the length of this game is ridiculous it is less then an hour I'm sure if you went through all the levels getting the collectibles it be a bit longer but no more then 2 hours it is ridiculous, if you are going to make a game with this kind of game play and non existent story telling at least make it long enough so people get their moneys worth. Another aspect I found odd was music or the lack of, the first time I heard music was in the last stage of the game and there was no epicness to it like in dark souls where music would only play during boss battles but dark souls made the iteration of music mean something, it made the player feel like they were doing something epic not bloody doing mundane platforming.So if you are looking to buy this game I wouldn't bother the $1 price it is definitely not worth it in the sate that it is in now.\n",

      "When I saw the other user reviews I thought that their playtimes were ridiculous and that you can't jugde it based on 0.3 hours but when I tried it I found you can judge it on 0.3 hours, the \"tutorial\" doesn't tell you anything about all the numbers popping on screen, it doesn't bother eplaining them, fortunately it's kind of obvious what they mean. It gives off the impression that it's a basic match 3 game but NOPE it's not, it's got various mechanics that might have actually been cool. However they don't bother explaining these until you have already figured them out, with the exception of the powers they do tell you about those.   Speaking about the powers, the ones they start you off with at first seem cool with Iron Man's repulsor blast dealing like solid 63 damage but later on the enemies have so much health it begins to suck. Also the story, I can't say I payed much attention to it because it was dumb but the writing was horrible it was cheesy and boring, not even cheesy and funny just boring and and the beginning they start off with Iron Man, yeah fine whatever but then they throw in Storm, for no reason at all just because why not, lets throw in a completely unrelated character to team up with Iron Man to take down some lame ... bad guys and the enemies have unoriginal names, like soldier and sniper. There is probably a pay to win aspect but I couldn't play it long enough to notice, oh wait yes I could in the first 5 minutes they tried to force me to use some healing thing to heal my hero which wasn't even badly damaged, if you don't heal your heroes they can't fight no matter how much health they have, they could be only 5 hp short and you'd just have to wait for them to heal or use up one health pack if your lazy and eventually enemies deal enough damage to prevent you from playing for a minimum if 4 minutes if you don't use the health pack, how do you get more health packs? You either play missions which you can't do because your hero is injured or you buy them. Don't waste your time with this go play Bejeweled on your phone or something instead.\n",

      "Okay so i really want to like this game, but it has one huge fatal flaw: It's fun value rapidly runs out once you realizse that literally everything but the Duck Billed Dinosaurs will kill you no doubt.... It's at this point that the game stops being a survival game, an starts to be an unpaid fulltime job. See the promise of a survival game is that the longer you play, the more survivable & fun it becomes as you master your terrain. Ark on the other hand, the more work you put in, the more work there is to put in. Once you've built your house of straw, it's on to your house of wood, once you've got your house of wood, it's on to the house of stone & it's like that with literally everything in the game: There is no pay off.An if you are the least bit effective early on in the game, the leveling system outstrips the actual content, in that it stops being a survival game & rapidly becomes an eating, drinking & pooping simulator, because thats what you spend your entire time doing, as you wait for your xp to bring you up to the next level.As for the PVE aspects of the game they leave a lot to be desired. Dinosaurs just mill around, instead of moving with any purpose, and there are just way to heavily packed together on a map that is way to small. God help you if you don't stick to the beach the entire time, because predatory dinosaurs are so common place off the beach that it often feels like you are being Zerged by small predatory dinosaurs, or worse yet the insects.Which brings me to my next issue: Movement tracking. I don't mind combat with the dinosaurs, or at least i wouldn't if i ever got in to combat with the dinosaurs, rather than shadow boxing the fart of existance that the program thinks are the dinosaurs locations, when actually the dinosaur is three feet, that a way.The game lacks for telegraphing so dinos attack, before lacky banding back to the location they were in, without passing through the space between. The worst offenders are the spitting dinosaurs & the raptors, but it's alsoa problem with any of the insects, and even the Bronto's who kill you by magic apparently, because you'll never see what they hit you with. I'm sure there is a playable game under there somewhere, but it's not nearly as deserving of praise as it's currently getting.\n",

My Message To UberStep up and take responsibility, your fans aren't here to wipe your asses with dollar bills.

      "Sonic Adventure DX for PC is just so, amazingly... ok. It just trys to be something absolutly huge for the franchise, mixing dramatic storytelling with the rush of Sonic gameplay, and yeah, at the time and on the right hardware, this was revolutionary. Its just plain awful today.The advancements in PC gaming make the attempts for story telling, and the technology used for this effect just laughable. Seriously, the developers of the PC version must have LOW expectations. Your first playthrough of this game (all campaigns) will be memorable for years to come, but not in a good way.  Why?Because this PC port is complete .... Missing button presses was a frequent problem through my experience, no matter how many different keyboards and computers I played on. (tested on 5, btw) For example, During the final boss fight of Amy's campaign, during phase 3, I game-overed 3 times from full lives because of the missed presses. In the fight, you have to jump over an obstacle. In my experience, Amy jumped probably 3/4 of the time. Eventually I got so badly ...... off at the game, I borrowed a second USB keyboard just to double my button presses.This problem was only present in the Boss fights. There is literally no reason for this.Why do I say thats its OK then? Well, Sonic Adventure DX is on the fence on being Good or Bad. The cornyness of the cinematics makes it funny and good, but only seconds later, a glitch where you are thrown uncontrolably off a stage by a pickup, losing a life and possibly game-overing you makes it bad. This effect (and unfortunatly glitch) happens frequently.If you are curious, wait untill it's like $1 in a sale before you buy. Just the hours alone and ONLY the hours alone playing this game would justify that price. If you are on the fence, just don't.Here's hoping Sonic Adventure 2 isn't this broken.\n",

[will put in negatives]Now... Those were the only good things, bad things now- Every character play nearly the same except weiss which she can be upgraded to range spam- There is no immersion in the characters as their semblances dont exist here [eg Yangs rage, Blakes decoys that take the hit for her etc]- Enemies are repetitive as well and once you learn their patterns its easy to get around their guard [if i could learn in my playtime, something went wrong]. Even the [REDACTED] is stupid as you can pratically stand still most of the fight and wait fo [REDACTED] then attack the weak point.- Short and easy campaign. The defense missions are a joke as you can just let the ones attacking the centre to attack it and it wont matter at all- All the projectile shots do the same damage [i would expect rubies 50 cal to do more than blakes 9 mm]- Boils down to the same comboes on most enemies [eg. Yang, Ruby and Blake use Light, Light, Heavy to take out the lightest enemies in one combo]Bugs t_t # Playing singleplayer will cause you to lose the levelling progress on your character# Counters and Finishers wont register properly sometimes leaving you vulnerableOverall: This game was not what i was wanting in a RWBY game.

It's not challenging, it's just a painful bore.The way difficulties of safes to lock-pick and terminals to hack is really scattered, it feels like they've just randomly chosen which ones will be novice, adept and masterful in terms of skill required, instead of placing expert locks in hard to reach areas, and novice ones in clear view places.I'm 8 hours in and I'm yet to meet an interesting character that influences my decisions and draws my attention into the conversation in any way.Also it is v-sync locked and 60fps locked (72 if you have 144hz monitor) and unlocking will speed up the game world and break dialogue options.\n",

Its a long grindfest at first since you are pretty weak at the start, but as you level up and upgrade your stats and equipment it does get somewhat easier though it still provides a challenge regardless.The story is kind of there but not all that interesting though there is a interesting plot twist at the very end, though story can be found as well through diary entries you will discover through your numerous playthroughs.

       " \"Decided to write this one a quick review because at the time of writing it's on sale. I bought this game a few months back when it was $20 and it was worth it. It's a fairly challenging coop shooter with Zombies and it's a lot of fun. Plus it's 3 games in one, so for $8.99 it's a steal. This game features the stories from NZA 1 and 2 with updated textures, an exclusive third story continuing on from the other two that you can only buy in this collection, and a decent survival mode which is also exclusive to the trillogy. All are available in 4 player coop.It has a fairly healthy online community, but it's certainly best with friends, which is why I don't have much time on it. That said, it has a certain dark humour to its story which makes it both endearing, but also a bit terrifying at times. If you're a fan of Call of Duty Zombies, particularly World at War, you'll probably love this. I have a fairly mid range PC (AMD FX-6300, R9 270x) and I run this at 80 fps 1080p on high with supersampling off and it runs beautifully. The graphics are pretty decent too.If using an Xbox controller is your thing, the controller support is fantastic. Simply turn it on at any point and it'll work just fine. I use a 360 controller, but the game most certainly supports an Xbone controller too (it's image is used in the controls section of the options).Basically, buy it now while it's on sale because it's great. If you happen to read this after a sale, it is still worth getting it over the other two if you want both.\",\n",

I semed to get hit a hell of a lot yet didnt seem to lose much in the way of health, and I found the constant birage of new spawning enemies somewhat unrealistic. however if you like a tactical run and gun style gameplay with constant enemy attacks to overcome then this is a good game choice.I thought the size of this game was a little on the high end. (above 10gb) but I gues for the age of it and the probable unnecessary programming for the time I cant complain to much. I just wish it had been a bit longer play time for the size.overall, now that I have the sound issue fixed, I found this to be an enjoyable title. Hovever for the age and play, I found the original farcry to be a much better more well thought out game, except for the 2 stupidly annoying boss battles. my oppinion if you want this game get it and you shouldnt regret it, but get the original farcry aswell and note the difference for yourself.\",\n",

And a lot of people have gone on to say that it's just a time waster, but no, it's more than that. Like an RPG game, it'll take you into the story the best it can. It's up to you, if you let it do it's job or not.And as such, this took me to believe that not many people gave it that starting chance. The chance to change their lives forever.Now, you might be thinking I'm biased, and yeah, I am. I never got the chance to grow up with great games that were released on older gen consoles. Like the NES, the SNES, and even the Sega Mega Drive. I got to miss the truly astonishing ups and lows of gaming history. All because I'm a kid.

       " \"Killing floor is a wave based zombie shooter with 8 different types of zombies/mutants and a player limit of 6 or so (many more on modded servers though). Game play is basic you pick a perk (Demolitions (grenade launchers and my fav), Support (shotgun and welder), Sharpshooter (pistols and rifles), Berserker (Melee weapons), Pyro (flame based weapons), Medic (Obvious), Commando (Assault rifles). You can purchase weapons of any class at the end of a wave at a trader which is open for a variable amount of time based on settings. In addition to your weapons every class has a medic gun and a welder (both work only at melee range) but their effectiveness is based on your perk. You can weld certain doors and gates closed letting you hold off the horde that little while longer. Guns sound awesome, a decent variety for each class. You are limited by a weight limit for how many weapons you can carry though (not by slots). The base game has quite a few maps including a couple of objective maps as well as a few sandbox settings and difficulty levels. The base game is quite fun for the first few weeks but starts to get samey/grindy which is why i HIGHLY recommend to play on a modded server. There is also a lot of things on the workshop page (especially modded maps) which i also recommend checking out too. The workshop is why i kept playing from 30 hours onward. The game also has holiday orientated events (Halloween redneck zombies, evil Santa)Graphics are okay (game is a couple of years old) and it is very gory with no geo block :D. Which is why the demo class is so fun XD. Sounds are pretty good, guns feel nice (especially the 9mm). Maps vary from open, outdoors, corridors, small e.c.t so there is a lot of variety there. That about sums up KF, its simple but fun. I would recommend it (especially on sale), it also is still receiving updates. (Don't think i forgot anything).\",\n",

       " \"If you didn't already notice, this game's concept is loosely based off of the Maximum Overdrive movie in the 80's. Except in this game, you get to play as the machines taking over the world. The gameplay is fun, and very satisfying. The visuals are nice. They are somewhat akin to that of Katamari Damacy. As of right now, there are only 3 modes, all of which have different goals (Did not get to play the Sandbox Mode when I tried the game, but it's basically like the other modes, just with no goal). In arcade mode, you try to destroy as much as possible, to score as high as possible within 3 minutes. In Gman elimination mode, you must destroy a certain number of MIB (Men In Black) before the time runs out. Overall, the game was fun, and should get better with more refining whilst in early access. The only gripe I have with the game, is that the controls feel a little strange, mainly when operating the camera when you aren't in a vehicle, and are searching for one to control on the map. Overall though, i would recommend this game :)If you're interested, i made a video on the game, which i've put below.\",\n",

       " 'Let\\'s start off with something, this game is amazing.When you first start off in the game your going to be put in a Battlefeild/Counter strike enviroment, choosing between two teams (Insurgency or Security), you will be faced with a detailed loadout selection and class selection. Each class on each team has access to different guns, attachments etc. And you have a set amount of equipment tokens/points to spend on your loadout. You also have a weight meter which can determine whether your loadout will make you run fast or slow, and how fast your stamina will run out.Now lets get into the combat:The combat is fast paced at times and slow paced at others, you will constantly find yourself having to visually inspect whether you have killed a person and wondering \"should i check or should i run past and hope the enemy is dead\". From the last sentence you probably can tell the game is going to be realistic. It is. If you move up on your own your playing a wild card, instead you might want to call out a couple of your teammates to help you complete/capture an objective (Yes, there are a lot of different gamemodes to choose from, most of which include control areas). There is virtually no HUD (Heads Up Display), the only things that do show up on the hud is how many magazines you have, and info about the objective(s). The gunplay is realistic, recoil is a thing and attachments can supress that recoil but also you can by swithing modes on your gun or burst firing. 1-2 bullets from most guns can take down an enemy.Lets talk graphics:The graphics in the game are not spectactular, but still enough to immerse you in the gameplay, though the design and textures on the weapons look great. You can\\'t really expect a game run and made on the source engine  and is only slightly modified is going to get you amazing Battlefield graphics.Overall Gameplay:The gameplay is realistic, tense and rewarding if you play the game right, what a mordern military shooter should be, it offers great and realistic gunplay, a variety of gamemodes and maps. Insurgency will keep you coming back to play some more (also teamwork is a thing in this game).',\n",

Once you are done deciding which hero you want you can unlock 1 hero for free to lvl it to 60 (I suggest taking Deadpool 1st, since he has no energy cost and is fun to play).   Everytime you play the game, the game will drop Eternity Splinters for you to pick up, don\\'t ignore them. You can use those Eternity Splinters to buy more heroes from the \\'Eternity Splinter\" vendor. You don\\'t need to spend real/steam money for playing the game. The only thing you can might need to spend money is the costumes, but random costumes can be crafted too when you do Prestige. Prestige is releveling a hero from 0 to 60 once again, everytime you prestige you get a original costume of a hero, you can use 3 of the original costumes to craft 1 random costume.  There is atleast 1 event going on every month which will keep you hooked up to the game. The devs make sure the events are glitch-free.  The only thing I don\\'t like about this game is that the default inventory is too short, and the Eternity Splinter price of STASH is also too high (600 Splinters) which takes long time to aquire compared to Random hero unlock box (175 Splinters).

Military vs Fantasy is also pretty cool. I do believe however, the game is a little unbalanced (eg mass air ), but that is to be expected as the game has just come out. There are also a few typos here and there (eg the tech trees). It would also be pretty cool if we could still have the 8-Bit Armies music in the game when the original factions are selected.

Anyways, it was a beautiful game with fast and stylish combat as well as vivid characters and decent humour. I suggest you give it a try until the end. The main problems for me when playing is that, the game is quite slow and tedious. At the beginning, of course this shows the most but as you progress through, entering each area and doing each quest was indeed slow. It was worthwhile though because you were awarded with rewards. I still recommend this game for all ages. I have friends playing this game from as young as 10 to 30 xD. 8.5/10 Great combat and story.\",\n",
       " 'This would have to be one of the best Early Access titles that I purchased. Being a big fan of the original installment, when I heard about the second installment, I was excited. Did this game manage to live up to the excitement? Yes, Definitely! The only \"flaw\" currently that I have found is the lack of content, BUT! This game is in Early Access and more content will obviously be added. From the (as of 24/04/2015) 4 hours that I spent playing this game, both solo and with friends, I feel like this game has incredible promise.The good:*Visuals - This game\\'s visuals are stunning. The graphics have received a very nice upgrade from this game\\'s predecessor, without taking away from the style that the first game portrayed.*Performance - This game has very good optimization. I was able to run the game on medium to high on my low end PC and still manage a stable 60fps, with only a few ocassional drops.*Gore - The gore system got a massive overhaul, which just makes it so much more satisfying to blow the heads off of Zeds and watch it literally explode, spraying everything in blood. Each Zed has a huge amount of points of dismemberment, so you can quite literally tear them limb for limb.*UI - The user interface got some heavy tweaking compared to the first game, making everything more sleek and easy to access. The Vendor Pod has a very nice interface as well, with everything laid out infront of you without having to scroll down or across.*Classes - Although only 4 of the classes are available at this point in time, the skills/class perks feel rewarding for the effort you put in. *SDK - The game has been noted to have the SDK and community creations implemented later on in development, which is great, as I found the community creations one of the best parts of the first game.*Humour - That\\'s right, the wonderful British banter from the first game makes a comeback, better than ever. I mean who doesn\\'t love British people insulting zombies. :P*Dosh - Aww yis, the dosh now has physics! You can literally make piles of money. When encountered with large crowds, it can be quite annoying being spun around every couple of seconds having to bash a zed away, only to be grappled by another one and spun around. I personally preferred the grappling from the first game, where they just slow down your movement, until you can\\'t move.*Servers - I\\'m giving the game credit with this one, but I\\'m just going to list it here for the time being, since I consider it a negative part. (At this point in time). Currently the servers that are available are almost all full, with only a few with much higher latency being available. All of the ones with great ping and empty are privated however. This wouldn\\'t be too much of a problem, but as of this point in time, the method for creating a dedicated server for the game is quite tedious. >Also, I\\'m not sure if this is a glitch, but 90% of the time, when a game is finished I am often sent back to the main menu screen, even on my friend\\'s game<All in all, if you\\'re a fan of the original installment, I\\'d highly recommend picking this up. If you\\'re a bit sceptical about purchasing games that are in Early Access, I\\'d probably suggest giving this one a miss until the price drops for a sale, as there currently isn\\'t too much content. If you\\'ve never played the first game in the franchise, but you\\'re interested in Zombie Survival games, such as Left 4 Dead, I recommend giving this game a try. I can definitely see myself sinking more hours into this game as it develops.',\n",

I can say the same for the Far Cry series too.  I suppose I could add Just Cause to the list it beats but I have only played 3 hours of JC2 after getting a little tired of it, the same can't be said for SR3 though, it made me want to come back for more and more!Saints Row 2 was indeed a poor port in the fact that driving was fairly hard as the game played at an increased speed.

The game is well made and the continuous content updates are great, a good thing that separates Golbal Offensive from Source is the new guns and the weapon skins for each gun giving you the ability to have cooler looking guns, and more importantly StatTrak which gives players who can afford it the ability to count their kills. The micro-transactions in this game are not forced onto you but it is a good way to gamble, like if you spend $20 on an unboxing and get a $120 knife from it you made profit, or you lose money (that is why it's gambling), and the operations which give you earlier access to community made maps and keep a personal record of your competitive scores. This game is one of the best First Person Shooters out there and I'd give it a 9/10. The EMS competitions give players the chance to try get their name out there in the CS:GO community and also win big cash, and for those who are not a good enough player who can't assemble a team it is great fun to wath.\",\n",

I can honestly say that SALT has really done an incredible job the Dev's I take my hat off to.What I cannot believe is that I was just in time to see some real development in the game, as I began playing SALT just before this update was released, so I was able to see the ship models and textures before. after the update I was blown away by its detail upgrade. Highly recommend SALT and can only assume the best of its potential.I would say 10/10 but as I am only 2 hours in, I will have to give 8/10 until my excitement and enthusiasm dies down.

Jokes aside they are most likely blind and are way below the system specs to play this fantastic masterpiece of a game.And so what if Sean Murray lied? Subnautica has higher ratings and that's not even as big as No Man's Sky. And Subnautica has almost the same graphics as NMS so what's your problem?! Sure, multiplayer may or may not be implented because of ONE INCIDENT. But even if Sean Murray lied about that just accept the way NMS is! Not as many Subnautica features were lied about but even if they were, what difference would it make? The same's with NMS. Subnautica doesn't have Multiplayer, and so what? NMS doesn't either! Review No Man's Sky is actually a very fun game to play. Watching it is boring as hell, though. I immediately got hooked into the game as soon as I started playing. Unfortunately this game isn't for everyone. There's little variety in the genre and it really sticks to one thing; Exploration. If you can't stand exploring planets on foot and seeing different terrains, this game isn't for you.Also you can't build in No Man's Sky, just pointing that out.Now here's the good bit. On every planet you go to, all the animals' voices are different, they look different, EVERYTHING. IS. DIFFERENT. No joke, even the plants! On every planet! Imagine that, a game with everything completely unique to the last planet you visited. Nifty eh?Now no game is perfect and the same's with this game. Obviously this is indie so I won't be too harsh. Pros • Endless, unique gameplay.• Two different endings: Galactic Core and Atlas Path.• Every single creature is never the same from the last ones you saw on a different planet.• Ship varieties. (I often wait around at space stations waiting for an epic looking one)• Awesome soundtrack that plays throughout your gameplay.• 3 different races you can trade with, all with unique voices.• Massive exploration on either barren, rocky planets to lush planets filled with trees and life. Cons • Eventually gets a tiny bit repetitive.• To save, you must find a shelter. You can't just save anywhere.• Hard to find a good ship with lots of slots• Hard to get better Hyperdrives to travel to better systems (from worst to best, Yellow, Red, Green,      Blue)• Slow start. (except for people who preordered the game, you are fine.)Overall I think the game is great, and if you like exploring planets then the game is for you. Buy it while you can\",\n",

Matching up against others who have superior cards or/even duplicates or sets of 4 card(s) whom have purchased additional boosters, not only makes deck building difficult, ineffective but also increases the likelihood that you will be demorilised over and over again in matches against other opponents in 1 v 1 or free for all matching.I generally enjoy purchasing this product for the puzzle games, Last turn puzzles a few years ago were amazing and difficult/challanging. 2014 however showcases some very sub par puzzles games and this year, well, there are none.I played one game of free for all on 4 v 4 and I felt so far away from the game table I requested my flatmate to provide me a magnifine glass. myself and another player also realised 4 turns in that we had already lost when one of the players threw down some superior cards for which we had not even access to.This put me off continuing playing this game into the future as really there is no point unless I am wishing to invest into this.Suggestions would be to at least bring \"two headed giant\" match making back, a level par card selection by perhaps charging a set $15 fee from the start and not this \"micro transaction booster option\" which is poor oversight in my opinion and perhaps even a tournament mode where equal par magic the gatherers could paticipate tournaments of 10 players etc, round robin to then provide a level based system and a decent points rating for those wishing to climb to the top in rankings over time (by winning more tourney\\'s etc)Rating, interface, music score, Story concept 6/10 (as what else can you do with a story really)gameplay campaign 5/10 (as well the AI seems to get the perfect run of cards sometimes :S)Deck building feature, 8/10 as this is very flexibleCard selection 2/10 (extremely limited unless additional investments made)gameplay vs human 3/10 (for the reason you will become frustate that you are unable to build a deck that is consistent without investment into more booster packs)Overall I would probably rate Magic 2015 4/10',\n",

       " 'Hack, Slash, Loot, or \"HSL\", looks charming at first with it\\'s retro-style pixel art... until you realize that the gameplay is even more primitive. It is not an understatement to say that everything in this game either comes down to little more than random chance and comparing numbers. Combat is completely limited to clicking on an enemy until they die. That\\'s it. No special moves, no abilities, no changing gear, nothing. Sure, depending on your weapon you either use melee, ranged or magic attacks, but unless you\\'re fighting near a weapon drop you can\\'t change on the fly, plus your character will usually specialize in one type so there\\' very little reason to change unless you get VERY skewed consumable drops (more on that later). At best you can try to bottleneck enemies in doorways or tight coriidors to fight them one by one, or run away and hope you find something useful before you get surrounded, but that barely qualifies as \"strategy\". And even then, you still have to hope that RNGesus is smiling down upon you. The item system is almost as primitive. Most of the time, it feels less like you are trying to decide which weapon or piece of armor to equip, and more like you\\'re just comparing numbers (although special damage types such as the stunning Lighting do make things a little more interesting) As for consumables, you never know if a potion or w/e will help and/or hinder you, meaning once again it\\'s entirely up to luck rather than any sort of choice or strategy if it help you.Oh, and there\\'s no save system. At all.All in all, this game had a lot of potential, but instead the gameplay is comparable to banging your head against a wall while comparing helmets and popping pills that \"might\" make it hurt less. What this game needed was something, ANYTHING that might have made the gameplay more complex than dice rolling: Abilities/items to use in a pinch, swapping around weapons, etc etc: anything that would make success less dependant on how lucky you are.

The main purpose of this online game is to gather provisions, build a base, and defend said base against raids, or you can raid other bases. I have two major problems with it though. 1) the game's servers frequently reset, which can be every week, or more. This results in the base you spent so much time building, which may be days, to be erased. 2) as I mentioned, you can raid bases or be raided by other players. However, you are left vulnerable whilst you are offline. So people can raid your base while you're not there to defend it. This is really awful as it takes an incredibly long time to research and produce certain items.Some players may find this thrilling or challenging, but I find it frustrating and pushes me away from spending time in the game.

       " 'Excellent game made by skilled artists and 3D modellors. The team that manages the engine and physics are quite good, though not the best. Aircraft and vehicle modelleling is the greatest I\\'ve seen for a game with such a variety of vehicles. Gameplay is amazingly smooth and simple.I cannot recommend it due to many controversial decisions made by the developers. Ignoring the playerbase in terms of balancing the matchmaking. Gaijin have created a problem that only becomes worse. When there are many players playing a large range of vehicles, (generally) effective matchmaking would clump a few evenly matched vehicles together for an intense fight.However if a vehicle was introduced/\"balanced\" to be too effective/ineffective, naturally people would flock/avoid that vehicle. This creates increased queue times due to the inbalance of demand of vehicles. People complain and Gaijin allows a wider variety int he one game, this can (and did) lead to further imbalance. Thus, more people avoid it/leave. This makes the balancing act harder and both Gaijin and the playerbase stressed.Of course, this depends on your reason on playing War Thunder and the matchmaking may not be a concern, also Gaijin isn\\'t doing too badly at the moment, it\\'s just greatly inconsistent matchmaking leading to either utter defeat or victory simply due to vehicle selection and not player skill.Any aircraft could easily kill a much higher tiered aircraft if they\\'re not using their speed advantage or experience. I have killed MiG-15\\'s in an F6F Hellcat. However in ground forces, it is practically impossible to kill a much higher tiered tank due to their armor and firepower keeping you at a massive disadvantage.Game Modes:Arcade Battles:Best place to learn the ropes, manoeuvres target leading, positioning, awareness and map knowledge. Physics have been tweaked for faster gameplay and easier to handle aircraft. This mode is where I spent about half of my time on, learning how to fly different types of aircraft and their weapons. Ground forces arcade is very intense and can be very much run, gun, die repeat. Dodging cannons rounds and ramming enemies off cliffs.Realistic Battles:Common for more skilled players like myself. Vehicles perform closely to historical documents (which aren\\'t the most accurate due to multiple sources). Requires extensive knowledge of own vehicle, enemies and map to effectively defeat the enemy. In this game mode, teamwork and communication is also introduced. (Yes, teamwork and communication is almost non-existent in arcade) NOTE: Although teamwork is indeed key, people are people and will sometimes be selfish or ignorant which can lead to many losses. You basically have to hope that your team isn\\'t braindead to charge the enemy into a disadvantaged position.Simulator Battles:What is this? DEAD :(In aircraft used to force cockpit views and requires a joystick (although with practice you can go without). It tries to have the primary components of real combat without having to worry about issues real pilots have. Can be very intense however it has an extreme learning curve and almost certainly requires a wingman. Like RB, however these skills are truly put it to the test.The game indeed has its great moments, when the odds are stacked even greater against you than the developers intended and you still break through. However too often you\\'ll just die hopeless, with the only way of avoiding it is to drag out the match.',\n",

       " \"TL; DR version: for $9.99, this dlc is short and does not add any real content to the game that you can not go without.Now for the long version. I got this dlc as a part of my season pass, so I didn't pay the $9.99 price tag. But if you didn't buy a season pass and are considering buying this dlc separately, I recommend you do not.There are really only two new characters with a decent amount of interaction introduced in this dlc. One I felt was developed very well, and will keep as a companion for a while. The other, was very shallow. There was barely any character development to make me feel anything for them. They could have been a no name raider and plucked at the same heartstrings during the big choice of this dlc.The robot customisation added by this dlc is quite neat. All of it balances nicely with no obvious power play options. And it's fun to have your own custom companion. But this, ultimately, is no different to any other companion. Sure, I can give them sword arms, but I could just give another companion a sword for the same effect. The interface is also slightly confusing; it is difficult to follow what change in damage/resistance a mod will cause without doing the manual check yourself. I was beginning to trust those little +++.Coming into this dlc with a lv 50 character (playing on survival) I really only felt challenged on combat at one stage in this dlc. That's not isolated to this dlc though, I feel fallout 4 has difficulty issues regardless. But this dlc does nothing to rectify this.Oh and if you're not a junk hoarder then I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors amassing your new hoard if you want to build any decent robot mods.There are a few new weapons added in this dlc as well, with the majority being mele, then energy. These are not something a level 50+ is going to start using though. Even with full modification, they fail to pack any considerate punch.There are also some unique power armor mods added in this dlc, but they are non transferable and will only benefit energy weapons users.In the end this dlc adds some cool features to your settlement and a cool new companion, but other than that there is nothing really new that is worth the $9.99 pricetag if you're considering buying this dlc outright.\",\n",

Sent everyone back to an abysmal tech tree which made a level 100 and a level 1 the same sturdiness (armour wise).

HOWEVER, UPlay is a horrendous gaming network and a DRM of 3 installs is appalling (to say it kindly). When I discovered I could only install this on 3 machines I was quite disappointed. Ubisoft support also seems seriously lacking. My son recently made purchase of a hardcopy ubisoft title, registered it to his account but could not download it - was just stuck in a registration loop. He was outright ignored by Ubisoft/Uplay official support contact - even after posting for help on their Facebook page. Eventually he exchanged the game for something worth twice as much (and not needing Uplay). So he posted again to their facebook to let them know he didnt want their assistance anymore because they are useless and he had solved his problem. Within minutes they deleted his post from the page making us well aware that Uplay had seen his original help request but they had deliberately ignored it.I'd hate to see what will happen when I have to contact them for a new key for Anno when I next upgrade my machine. If the same DRM restrictions exist for the new Anno when it is released I simply wont be buying it ... ever.

There are unlockables like Perks, Offerings, Clothes, Items, Addons etc. You can level up your characters as well as your rank for both Survivor and Killer.You can also play private matches with your friends and you won\\'t lose anything if you do die as a survivor.The ranking system in my opinion is good enough for now; you collect these crystals (at least they look like crystals) called PIPS, according to the official Dead By Daylight Manual, and when you collect a certain amount in a row,  you get promoted. The lowest rank in the game is 20 and the highest rank is 1. To get from rank 20-19 you must collect 3 pips. From Rank 12 and onwards, you must collect 5 pips each rank down, meaning Rank 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 require 5 pips each before you get to Rank 1 for both Survivor and Killer.So the game seems cool, right? Well, most games aren\\'t that perfect...TLDR: Great Game, Fun, Lost of Unlockables, makes you want to continue playing, Private Matches, Ranking System, Collect Pips to Rank Up, Rank 20 lowest rank, Rank 1 Highest Rank.NEGATIVESThe only way to rank up in the game is to play public matches, and this makes it difficult because people try and find their friends so they search and quit lobbies until they find them because you currently CANNOT invite your friends to public matches, only private matches, and some players just boost each other. For example one person plays as the killer, hosting the lobby and the other playing as a survivor, and they troll you. There are many disadvantages in the game too, such as:- The host of every game is the killer. This is bad because almost every killer in the game has a .... ISP.- Everybody is searching for their friends, and sometimes it can take a while to find a game. The longest it took me to once find a game was 1 hour for this reason...- You will lag in almost EVERY game.- You WILL rage.- You WILL die in stupid ways.- You WILL get stuck in objects.- There are HACKERS in this game too!Now it\\'s time to elaborate on these points. The killer being the host of every game really annoys me, just because it gives them a huge advantage. Think of it like this; The host controls everything, and you and your friends are normal people doing normal stuff. But the host has .... internet, and because he controls everything, it affects you and your friends WAY more than it does for him. As a matter of fact, it doesn\\'t affect him at all. LAG will ruin you, and make you rage. I\\'ve lost many games just because of lag. But how does the lag affect you in game? Well, when you attempt to vault over something, like a wall or object, and you\\'re lagging, you are going to die, especially if the killer\\'s chasing you, because what happens is that rather than vaulting, your character FREEZES. Lag also makes you teleport literally everywhere and will get you killed. This is why you will rage and die in the most stupidest ways.You will also get stuck in objects. One time I spawned into a game (The developers call these TRIALS) and I was repairing a generator. Then the killer was coming towards me and I was thinking, \"Oh no problem, I will just hide behind this tree.\" So I go behind \\'This tree\\' and crouch and he walks past me. \"Yeh I\\'m all good.\" I think to myself. Then I go to walk away from the tree and then just like that, I was stuck. I literally couldn\\'t move, and the murderer was coming back. He walked past me again and didn\\'t see me. Although he didn\\'t see me, I was still very angry, because I wasn\\'t going to be able to survive unless I get him to kill me. So I just quit and also got demoted and lost my item. This is why the Killer has such a HUGE advantage in the game. This also isn\\'t the only object I\\'ve gotten stuck into.I have recorded games I\\'ve played where my connection with the Killer was very bad, and I will perhaps upload them soon to my Steam profile/YouTube channel (Link on Profile!). So be sure to check those out if you would like to see more on what I\\'m talking about.Last but not least, hackers, yes, there are hackers already... And the game was only recently released, EVEN with an ANTI-CHEAT! This just really confuses me as to why their anti-cheat software hasn\\'t even banned these players yet. I saw a player who had prestiged his Claudette Morel to level 1000, which at this stage, is an impossible stage to even be on. Most players, almost all, haven\\'t even prestiged, including myself. TLDR: Game has more negatives than positives. ConclusionSo to conclude my review, this game needs more development. The game is great and fun, but when you take the negatives into account, Dead By Daylight isn\\'t really the best game to buy at this time. I believe the developers didn\\'t give enough time on their project and should have continued developing the game and released it at a later date. But the developers are still working on patches and have apparently said they wil be allowing people to invite their friends to public games instead of just private games. So to say they should be adding more patches as well. But in the meantime, I recommend you should save your money for the time being and wait till more patches come through.Thank you for reading my review!',\n",

Toy Soldiers: War Chest is simple not worth the money that it asks for £11.99 (for the standard game) and £24.99 (for the hall of fame addition). Although it includes characters from different franchises you have to pay £3.99 for the privilage of owning that character - such as GI Joe and Cobra which is a real kick in the teeth! But the game forces you to do this as the basic armies are crap! The only playable basic army is the WW1 German Army, the rest are boring, stupid and a waste of time. On top this the game is meant for a console, you can't control aircraft because they do a million flips if you sneeze or move around (plus they are so weak!), the gameplay is repetative and boring, additionally none of your friends have the game or players who have the game don't do multiplayer.To Conclude:if you are looking for the following items in this gameNo or limited funBad/Mediocre reviews (check out gamespot or ign if you don't believe me)Expensive (£11.99 standard or +£3.99 for DLC or £24.99 for FULL Game)Lacking in gameplayLacking in friends and other human being who play this game!4 base armies - Only 1 playableMICROTRANSACTIONS -game currencyUPLAY the most pointless and worst system if to be invented by mankind!

       " \"This game is OK but not worth the $1 to throw at it. Not know that this was an early access game I threw myself in to it hoping for a fresh game, one I haven't seen before. So I did what I usually do... Not look at anything on the game. Well now I wish I would and finding out that it was early access after I had played it makes it worse. I already have a dislike to early access as most games get forgotten and unfinished and I don't like the idea of paying for a game that hasn't even been finished and the devise thought they could get a couple of bucks out of it before they actually bother finish it. I know this isn't every early access game but a lot are like this. This game from the looks of it was either rushed, not cared about enough, or by inexperienced devise. Im sorry if it's the last option but you will need some helpful criticism. First of all I noticed the controls for the torch, these are horrible you can either not do anything and it will snap to the direction you are facing which leads to very disorientating gameplay ad there is no smooth animation for the snap lock and leaves the player felling more or less dizzy, or you can hold the left mouse button the whole time to control the torch which is annoying while trying to do platforming but is much easier then the snap control. This was very annoying through he whole game as you do have to use the torch as a weapon and making it a prime function without taking much care for smooth animation is not done well. While trying to find an option to maybe have it as a consonant on the mouse control I found myself exiting the level which made me instantly dislike this game. First of all there was no are you sure you want to exit the level, second no indication what so ever through the game did it say if you want to exit the level press ESC, this may not seem like that big of a deal and it wouldn't be in any other situation but in mine I was near the end of the level with all the collectibles and I had exited and was forced to play the level again but this time I ha dlost interest in collecting the letters. Another issue I have is that there are no options, none what so ever, except when you boot up the game it asks what graphics you would like windowed yes or no and resolution, for the very basic of settings these are there is no way to change them in game. One other thing that really bugged me about this game is the ... narrator, jeez can you come up with some different lines, every single level has the narrator saying the same thing over and over again, it's like a broken record, and I'm not kidding at the start of every level there is the same cut scene of the narrator saying some bull and during every level he says the same thing, and at the end of every level there is another cut scene. Not to be discouraging the narrator has a nice voice but maybe get him a few more then 3 things to say. Now one thing that really bugged me about the game play was that every time you die you go all the way top the start of the level usually this would be OK, it gives consequence to the players death but it is so easy to die in this game from the odd camera angle and the (let' face it) cliché platforming with no real unique aspect means you have to start the level again and when this happens you loose all of your collectibles. This is the most frustrating part because even though the platforming is hard simply because of other issue and not the way it is designed, a big portion of the game comes froms getting the collectibles and after dying a few time to some random issue I quickly lost interest in getting the collectibles which unlock additional levels, which I could not bring my self to even collect the letter to play because I found myself wanting to stop playing this game instantly. Another aspect of the game I didn't enjoy was the enemy if you can even call them that, there are two enemy's, white slug things that slowly move towards you and little white sperm things that move quickly towards you, for a game with the subtitle 'A game to fight inner demons' I did not find myself fighting any inner demons the most I got was having a good laugh at the ridiculous design of an 'inner demon' and the variation of these inner demons (the small sperm things) do not come in till the 4th level which is the second last level in the game. Which brings me to my next point the length of this game is ridiculous it is less then an hour I'm sure if you went through all the levels getting the collectibles it be a bit longer but no more then 2 hours it is ridiculous, if you are going to make a game with this kind of game play and non existent story telling at least make it long enough so people get their moneys worth. Another aspect I found odd was music or the lack of, the first time I heard music was in the last stage of the game and there was no epicness to it like in dark souls where music would only play during boss battles but dark souls made the iteration of music mean something, it made the player feel like they were doing something epic not bloody doing mundane platforming.So if you are looking to buy this game I wouldn't bother the $1 price it is definitely not worth it in the sate that it is in now.\",\n",

However they don\\'t bother explaining these until you have already figured them out, with the exception of the powers they do tell you about those.   Speaking about the powers, the ones they start you off with at first seem cool with Iron Man\\'s repulsor blast dealing like solid 63 damage but later on the enemies have so much health it begins to suck. Also the story, I can\\'t say I payed much attention to it because it was dumb but the writing was horrible it was cheesy and boring, not even cheesy and funny just boring and and the beginning they start off with Iron Man, yeah fine whatever but then they throw in Storm, for no reason at all just because why not, lets throw in a completely unrelated character to team up with Iron Man to take down some lame ... bad guys and the enemies have unoriginal names, like soldier and sniper. There is probably a pay to win aspect but I couldn\\'t play it long enough to notice, oh wait yes I could in the first 5 minutes they tried to force me to use some healing thing to heal my hero which wasn\\'t even badly damaged, if you don\\'t heal your heroes they can\\'t fight no matter how much health they have, they could be only 5 hp short and you\\'d just have to wait for them to heal or use up one health pack if your lazy and eventually enemies deal enough damage to prevent you from playing for a minimum if 4 minutes if you don\\'t use the health pack, how do you get more health packs?

It's at this point that the game stops being a survival game, an starts to be an unpaid fulltime job. See the promise of a survival game is that the longer you play, the more survivable & fun it becomes as you master your terrain. Ark on the other hand, the more work you put in, the more work there is to put in. Once you've built your house of straw, it's on to your house of wood, once you've got your house of wood, it's on to the house of stone & it's like that with literally everything in the game: There is no pay off.An if you are the least bit effective early on in the game, the leveling system outstrips the actual content, in that it stops being a survival game & rapidly becomes an eating, drinking & pooping simulator, because thats what you spend your entire time doing, as you wait for your xp to bring you up to the next level.As for the PVE aspects of the game they leave a lot to be desired. Dinosaurs just mill around, instead of moving with any purpose, and there are just way to heavily packed together on a map that is way to small. God help you if you don't stick to the beach the entire time, because predatory dinosaurs are so common place off the beach that it often feels like you are being Zerged by small predatory dinosaurs, or worse yet the insects.Which brings me to my next issue: Movement tracking. I don't mind combat with the dinosaurs, or at least i wouldn't if i ever got in to combat with the dinosaurs, rather than shadow boxing the fart of existance that the program thinks are the dinosaurs locations, when actually the dinosaur is three feet, that a way.The game lacks for telegraphing so dinos attack, before lacky banding back to the location they were in, without passing through the space between. The worst offenders are the spitting dinosaurs & the raptors, but it's alsoa problem with any of the insects, and even the Bronto's who kill you by magic apparently, because you'll never see what they hit you with.

Its just plain awful today.The advancements in PC gaming make the attempts for story telling, and the technology used for this effect just laughable. Seriously, the developers of the PC version must have LOW expectations. Your first playthrough of this game (all campaigns) will be memorable for years to come, but not in a good way.  Why?Because this PC port is complete .... Missing button presses was a frequent problem through my experience, no matter how many different keyboards and computers I played on. (tested on 5, btw) For example, During the final boss fight of Amy's campaign, during phase 3, I game-overed 3 times from full lives because of the missed presses. In the fight, you have to jump over an obstacle. In my experience, Amy jumped probably 3/4 of the time. Eventually I got so badly ...... off at the game, I borrowed a second USB keyboard just to double my button presses.This problem was only present in the Boss fights. There is literally no reason for this.Why do I say thats its OK then? Well, Sonic Adventure DX is on the fence on being Good or Bad. The cornyness of the cinematics makes it funny and good, but only seconds later, a glitch where you are thrown uncontrolably off a stage by a pickup, losing a life and possibly game-overing you makes it bad. This effect (and unfortunatly glitch) happens frequently.If you are curious, wait untill it's like $1 in a sale before you buy.

[will put in negatives]Now... Those were the only good things, bad things now- Every character play nearly the same except weiss which she can be upgraded to range spam- There is no immersion in the characters as their semblances dont exist here [eg Yangs rage, Blakes decoys that take the hit for her etc]- Enemies are repetitive as well and once you learn their patterns its easy to get around their guard [if i could learn in my playtime, something went wrong]. Even the [REDACTED] is stupid as you can pratically stand still most of the fight and wait fo [REDACTED] then attack the weak point.- Short and easy campaign. The defense missions are a joke as you can just let the ones attacking the centre to attack it and it wont matter at all- All the projectile shots do the same damage [i would expect rubies 50 cal to do more than blakes 9 mm]- Boils down to the same comboes on most enemies [eg.
